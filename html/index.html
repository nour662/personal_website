                            Hello! I'm Nour. Thanks for taking the time to look at my page!</p>
                        <p class="text-md">
                            I’m currently pursuing my master’s degree in Information Management at the University of Maryland, where I also
                            serve as
                            the Evaluation Lead for the Mid-Atlantic I-Corps Hub. Throughout my academic journey, I’ve explored a wide range of
                            research areas, working on projects with various federal agencies and institutions. These experiences have shaped my
                            approach to problem-solving and reinforced my commitment to using technology to drive positive change.</p>
                    </div>
                </div>

                <p class="text-md">
                    One of the most rewarding aspects of working on diverse projects is the opportunity it provides to expand my skill set.
                    I firmly believe in the mantra, <strong>“If you don’t have it, work for it.”</strong> The best growth happens when you step outside of
                    your comfort zone, challenge your current capabilities, and push yourself to achieve more. I've consistently found that
                    pushing my boundaries leads to new opportunities and personal growth.</p>
                <p class="text-md">
                    Despite the variety of projects I’ve worked on, there’s one constant that ties them all together: <strong>data</strong>. Data is a
                    powerful tool that allows us to understand the present, make informed decisions, and—most importantly—create a vision
                    for a better future. It provides valuable insights that can be used to refine processes, improve systems, and make
                    data-driven decisions that lead to impactful outcomes. This is why data analytics and artificial intelligence have
                    become central to my academic and professional pursuits. The ability to harness these tools to not only analyze but
                    predict, optimize, and enhance outcomes is a driving force in my work. </p>
                <p class="text-md">
                    I’ve been coding for over 8 years and have worked with several programming languages, many of which are listed on my
                    <a class = "text-link text-md" href="resume.html">resume</a>. This technical background, coupled with my coursework, has given me a solid foundation in areas such as database
                    design, infrastructure and architecture, user-centered design, human-centered cybersecurity, data visualization, and
                    more.</p>
                <p class="text-md">
                    In my <a class= "text-link text-md" href="portfolio.html">portfolio</a>, you’ll find a selection of projects and courses I’ve worked on. Some are confidential and can’t be shared publicly,
                    but if you're interested, feel free to reach out, and we can arrange a time to discuss them in as much detail I am able to provide.</p>
